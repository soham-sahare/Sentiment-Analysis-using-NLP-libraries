# Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP-libraries

Reviews handled for the quality of movies.

Sentiment Analysis is defined as the process of mining of data, views, sentences, comments to predict the emotion, feeling of the sentence through Natural Processing Language (NLP). The analysis involves the classification of text into three phases as positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment Analysis is widely applied to reviews and survey responses, online social media, and many healthcare materials for applications.

In this project, I aim to perform Sentiment Analysis on the movie database i.e movie reviews database. Data used in this project can be seen here - http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz

We will be using several Python libraries and frameworks specific to text analytics, NLP, and ML. Dependencies - Pandas, NumPy, sci-kit-learn, scipy. NLKT version should be >= 3.2.4, otherwise, TokToktokenizer may not present.
